This repository contains the files and source code to probabilistically assess the lateral performance of pedestrian bridges under crowd-induced lateral vibrations. The method is explained in our publication:

Contreras, A., and Fermandois, G., and Heresi. P.: "Probabilistic Serviceability Assessment of Footbridges Subjected to Crowd-Induced Lateral Vibrations"
 

## Methodology
The problem is addressed in two stages. The first stage is modeling, which takes into account the bridge model, pedestrian lateral foot-force model, crowd behavior model, interaction between pedestrians and bridge. Then, the second stage is simulation with uncertainty incorporation and the a probabilistic analysis to the results.

## Requirements
* Matlab 2025b
* Simulink
