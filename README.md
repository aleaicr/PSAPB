# PPBLP - Probabilistic Pedestrian Bridges Lateral Performance
authors: Alexis Contreras R. & Gastón Fermandois C. 

This repository contains the files and source code to probabilistically assess the latearl performance of pedestrian bridges under crowd-induced lateral vibrations, the method is explained in our publication:

The method divdes the problem in three stages. First, the bridge model, in this study we used a simplified model of an equivalent continuos beam and its dynamics is obtained by the Assumed Modes Method (further complexity is recommended for specific bridges). Second, the pedestrian lateral foot-force model, this is a novel model that uses a Van der Pol oscillator and
