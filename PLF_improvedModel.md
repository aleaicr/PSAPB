After calibration for multiple masses and walking frequencies
Add new variables 
k1=1.5 (1 is enough, but looks more accurate with 1.5)
k2=4
k3=1

So
lambda1 = k1 x lambda1
lambda2 = k2 x lambda2
lambda3 = k3 x lambda3

I will consider them constants for now, but can also be variables with uncertainty.
